# USA Computing Olympiad

- The USA Computing Olympiad (USACO for short) is a programming competition for middle and high schoolers
- It occurs 4 times a year
  - December
  - January
  - February
  - March
- Each contest consists of 3 problems, and you are given 4 hours (5 hours for the March contest) to solve them
- Each problem contributes to $\frac{1}{3}$ of your score, and getting 1000 points is a perfect score
- There are 4 divisions: **Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum**
- If you perform well on a given contest, you'll get promoted to the next division for next month and beyond
- You do not need to get a perfect score to promote, you just need to pass the cutoff
  - Cutoff usually varies from 650-850, depends on how difficult the problems are and how well other contestants do
- **Bonus:** if you get a perfect score of 1000, you will get an *in contest promotion*, which means you get to take the contest for the next division during the same weekend without needing to wait until next month
  - Because of this rule, it is possible to promote from bronze all the way to platinum in just one weekend if you are good enough

## How does solving problems work?

- When you submit your program, your program gets automatically tested by their server machines on 10-15 test cases
  - The first test case is always guaranteed to be the sample input
- You will receive a verdict for each test case based on the execution result. Some of the common ones:
  - **Correct answer:** your program produced the correct answer for that given test case, so you get points. Hooray!
  - **Wrong answer:** your program produced the wrong answer for that given test case.
  - **Time limit exceeded:** your program took too longer than the permitted time limit of 2 seconds.
  - **Runtime error or memory limit exceeded:** your program either crashed from an error or used more memory than permitted

## Tips for Good Performance

- **Take your time!** 4 hours is a long period of time, so make sure you read the problem carefully and write clean code so it's easy to debug.
- **Get partial credit whenever possible!** You don't need to fully solve all problems to pass, so even a semi-decent solution can net some points.
- **Try different approaches!** If you get stuck on a problem, try making observations to break it down. Approach it from a different angle. Experiment with different ideas and see which works.
